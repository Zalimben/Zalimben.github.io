In this post, we will go over Git branching strategy and Git workflows, it will not focus on comparing Git branching models, nor explain one by one as that story has been told more than once, but you will find the links and examples of these strategies to read more about each one.

## Introduction

[Git](https://git-scm.com/doc) has become the *de facto* standard for source control management. Branching is an essential feature of a [VCS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) (version control system), that allows developers to diverge from the main line of development and continue their work on multiple features in parallel, without affecting the main line.

Git allows teams to tweak git workflows, as it fits the team’s culture. As a result, teams and organizations are often required to choose a particular branching strategy that matches their release cadence, while optimizing productivity depending on their team size, strengths and weaknesses.

Some git branching models are best in certain situations, but none can be considered the *best*,therefore, it is important to mention that there is no such thing as "Best Git Branching Model" or "Best Git Workflow" or "Best Gitflow" or any of its variations, but what you may find is "A successful Git branching model" which is true as Git workflows are flexible and change as needed, so in certain situations, one git workflow is better than others, simple as that.


This post performs a comparative analysis of the three most popular branching strategies, namely, Git Flow, Trunk based development and GitHub Flow.


### Git branching models
#### [Git Commonflow](https://commonflow.org/)
#### [Git-flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
#### [GitLab flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html)
#### [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
#### [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)
